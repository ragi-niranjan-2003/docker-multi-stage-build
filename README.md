In this Golang Multi-Stage Docker Build project, I applied the
multi-stage build approach to optimize a Docker image for
production. By separating the build and runtime stages, I
managed to keep only the essential runtime files in the final
image, which drastically reduced its size. It was a rewarding
project that helped me understand how to make Docker images
lean and secure for production.
